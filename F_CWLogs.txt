Application monitoring is a process that 
ensures that a software application processes and 
performs in an expected manner and scope. 
If any Unexpected error are coming 
we need to notify to the Techinal Team

Ex :1) Lets take "Net Banking Application"
    Which is hosted on the Server .
	End users accessing the the Application.
	In Last 10 min if we get more the 1000
	invalid users error / Bal Transfer error/
	Invalid Pin etc We need to send the Alter.
	
   2) For Example all end user activities
     are storged in the log file inside 
	 the server.
   3) From That log file if you want to extract 
      specific error,you need write the Script
       and need to send Noticifation.	  
   4) For Each and every error code we need 
      write the script.
   6) To Avoid These this AWS as given  
      "CloudWatch Log" service.
